                <h2>alright, so here it starts</h2>

                <p>i have always wanted a blog. i just never really had stuff to yap about until a friend of mine
                    convinced me to make it anyway!</p>

                <p>perhaps this way i will finally be motivated to actually do things, and write about them. i have a
                    few projects lined up that i still need to get up from my ass for and actually finish them.</p>

                <p>this website was one of them...</p>
